# InvisiCode
InvisiCode is a Java-based tool for educational purposes, demonstrating how keystrokes can be captured in controlled environments. It aims to teach ethical hacking and cybersecurity concepts. Use only in secure, authorized environments for learning about keylogging and system security vulnerabilities.

The project demonstrates the process of capturing keystrokes and storing them in a log file, which can be used for research, development, or authorized security testing.

## Features

- **Keystroke Capture**: Logs every keystroke made by the user.
- **Log Storage**: All keystrokes are written to a real-time firebase database.
- **Lightweight**: The program runs in the background, and no user interface is shown unless the program is opened.
- **Written in Java**: Built using Java’s `KeyListener` and `FileWriter`, making it easy to compile and run.

⚠️ DISCLAIMER:
This project is created strictly for **educational and ethical research purposes**.
Do NOT use this software on machines you do not own or without explicit permission.
The developer is NOT responsible for any misuse.

### Key Highlights:

- **Ethical Considerations**: This emphasizes the importance of using the keylogger only with explicit permission and under legal circumstances.
- **Contributing**: Provides guidance for others interested in contributing to the project.
